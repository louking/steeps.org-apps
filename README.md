# steeps.org-apps
google apps scripts stored on steeplechasers.org

Each directory represents a single google apps script.

To reuse the scripts under the directories, you need to create a google apps script, 
and then create file within the script for each file in the directory.

For .js and .css files, the filename within the script will have .html after the given filename.

Best workflow

* edit script file(s) within git directory using editor of choice
* for each file which changed
  * copy all from editor of choice
  * select all in google apps script file, paste (overwrite complete file)
